# Markov Chain Visualizer

## Purpose

This project aims to help understand how a Markov chain works by visualizing it step-by-step.

A Markov chain is a way to model random processes where the next state depends only on the current state, not on how you got there. It’s used in many fields like physics, finance, and language processing to predict or simulate sequences that follow this “memoryless” property.

By building this visualizer, the goal is to make the concept of Markov chains easier to grasp through interactive examples and animations.

## What is it?

It’s a simple web app that shows states and transitions of a Markov chain, letting you see how the process moves from one state to another based on probabilities.

## How does it work?

- The states and transition probabilities are defined in the code.
- Each step randomly moves to the next state according to these probabilities.
- The visualization updates to show the current state and possible next moves.

## How to use it?

Open the `index.html` in a browser and watch the Markov chain progress step by step. You can modify the probabilities or states in the code to explore different scenarios.
